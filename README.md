This is a very exploratory repository. I am currently just playing around with trying to reproduce different papers related to quant in the hopes of understanding what the current industry is doing and hoping to employ my own ideas later on.


Currently in the field of quant a lot of things may be not reproducable and therefore I think that moving foward I am going to look at more reputable papers and try and reproduce those first.


Start from something easier and then trying to optimise it further.
