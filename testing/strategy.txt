to do:

new strategy:

look at the correlation between the same stock but listed on different exchanges.

can you short / long position based on time differences and make a stop loss function 

because theoritically they should be the same price, maybe sometimes discrepencies such as
time differences or breaks for different stock exchange might affect stock values

also maybe such as in china , they have 10% stock limit? this might be winning potential
